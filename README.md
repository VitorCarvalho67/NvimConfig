This project provides a customized configuration of the Neovim editor, specifically tailored to my needs and developed in Lua. It focuses on enhancing Neovimâ€™s usability through plugins and custom scripts under the GPLv3 license. Key areas include Lua customization, Vim configuration, and Neovim plugins, making it ideal for those interested in personalizing their editing environment.

## How to use
Prerequisites
- neovim

If you don't have neovim, can install using:
```bash
# win
scoop install neovim
choco install neovim
# linux
sudo apt install neovim
sudo dnf install neovim
sudo pacman -S neovim
```

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VitorCarvalho67/NvimConfig.git
```

Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd NvimConfig
```

These steps will get you set up with the initial files on your local machine. Next, you can proceed with installing any required plugins and configuring Neovim to use these settings by copying or linking them to your Neovim configuration directory, typically located at ~/.config/nvim. If your setup involves additional steps like installing dependencies or configuring plugins, remember to include those to ensure a smooth setup.
